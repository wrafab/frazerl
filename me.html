<h1> About Lee Frazer </h1>
<p> Hi, this is my website for Digital Engineering and Fabrication.
 My name is Lee Pierre Boyd Frazer and I am from Chagrin Falls
 Ohio. I'm not the biggest fan of school but I do enjoy science 
 and math, which will hopefully help me pursue my dreams of 
 becoming an engineer. I am a big fan of sports. I play football, 
 basketball, and lacrosse. My favorite sport is lacrosse since I 
 have been playing since I was in second grade. I also love 
 sleeping and eating. That's all for my about me page! </p>
