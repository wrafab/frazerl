<h1> About Lee Frazer </h1>
<p> Hi, this is my website for Digital Engineering and Fabrication. My name is Lee Pierre Boyd Frazer and I am from Chagrin Falls Ohio. I'm not the biggest fan of school but I do enjoy science and math, which will hopefully help me pursue my dreams of becoming an engineer. I am a big fan of sports. I play football, basketball, and lacrosse. My favorite sport is lacrosse since I have been playing since I was in second grade. I also love sleeping and eating. That's all for my about me page! </p>
